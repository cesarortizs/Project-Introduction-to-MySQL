**Understanding Database Basics**

Databases are storages where we can persist the data of our application, this is esential if we want to keep an state that can be saved everytime the applications stops and restored everytime the application restarts, therefore databases are essential in every program where we would like to have continuous functionality which are the majority these days, to give a particular example a bank application would be a perfect place to implement a database which can hold records for every user's banking and personal info, it can also include all the transactions done by them.


**Reflection Questions**

1. Why did you choose specific data types for the columns in the Students table? Explain how these data types help in storing student information efficiently?

The use of data types is not fundamental, but is very useful if we want to keep our data consistent and ensure it will have a certain behaviour, which is also important at the time of handling the data in future operations outside the RDBMS.


2. What are some benefits of using databases over simple file storage systems (like spreadsheets)?

First of all databases are designed to store and handle data efficiently, therefore they're faster and more reliable than a simple file, they can also directly implement other very useful functionalities like constraints, user permissions, encryption, indexing and plenty more.
